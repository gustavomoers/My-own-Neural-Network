# My-own-Neural-Network
 Learning project to create from scratch my own neural network algorithm with help of the professors from Data Science Academy.
 
 The model was tested using the Breast Cancer Dataset and got great results! Of course this model isn't as optmitized as the current frameworks available, but it was a great way of learning how neural nets works.
